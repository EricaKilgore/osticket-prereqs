<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps to create a virtual machine, install a ticketing system, and set up SQL.
<br>
<br>
To get started, we need to create a virtual machine in the Microsoft Azure portal (portal.azure.com). A virtual machine (VM) acts as a remote computer, allowing us to protect our physical machine in case something goes wrong and providing a clean, reusable environment for our lab setup. Begin by creating a resource group and naming it "osTicket".</p>

Next, connect to your new VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with the public IPv4 address. If you're using a Mac, you'll need to download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app first.

<p>
Once connected to your VM, you'll need to enable IIS. Go to the Control Panel, select "Uninstall a program," and then click "Turn Windows features on or off" on the left. From the list that appears, enable Internet Information Services (IIS).

Great! Now that IIS is enabled, the next step is to install the Web Platform Installer. Use the link provided here: Web Platform Installer Resources to access all necessary materials for setting up osTicket. Simply click the link and download the Web Platform Installer to proceed.

Excellent. Now that you have enabled IIS we need to install Web Platform Installer. I have provided a link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6
  That link will provide you with all of the material you need to download to get osTicket up and running. Simply click the link and install the Web Platform Installer

</p>
<p>
Once you have installed Web Installer Platform open it. From inside the application you are going to install MySQL 5.5 Afterwards install x86 version of PHP up until 7.3. There are some failed files such as C++ redistributable package as well as PHP 7.3.8 and PHP Manager for IIS those files can be found with the install link.

</p>
<p>
Next download osTicket. Then extract and copy the "upload" folder into c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Afterwards rename the folder to osTicket

</p>
<br />
<p>
</p>
<p>
Open IIS Manager and restart the server. Once inside IIS manager go to Sites->Default->osTicket on the right, click "Browse*.80" from there your default browser should open osTicket webserver.

<br />
<p>
</p>
<p>
Go back into IIS manager and enable some extensions. To do this you have to go to Sites->Default->osTicket
Then double click on PHP manager. Click on "Disable or enable an extension" Enable "php_intl.dll" & "php_opcache.dll" then refresh the osTicket webserver and obsereve the changes "Intl Extension" should now be enabled.

<p>
</p>
<p>
Go back into c:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php rename the file to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
Assign permissions to ost-config.php Disable inheritance->Removeall
New Permissions->Everyone->all

<p>
</p>
<p>
Afterwards continue setting up osTicket in the browser (click continue) then you will name the Helpdesk to your liking. Select a default email that will receive emails from customers who submit tickets.

<p>
<p>Continue Setting up osticket in the browser MySQL Database: osTicket MySQL Username: root MySQL Password: Password1 Click “Install Now!”
Congratulations, hopefully it is installed with no errors!
Clean up
Delete: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup
Set Permissions to “Read” only: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
Login to the osTicket Admin Panel (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php)
